# FBXMultiplatformImporter
This is a repository for a Unity3D project and a Visual Studio solution which interact with the FBX sdk to import FBX models on multiple platforms.


Original output directory for dll:
$(SolutionDir)$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\

The debug environment is in my EngineBJF solution.
